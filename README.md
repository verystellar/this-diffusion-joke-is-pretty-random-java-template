# This Diffusion Joke is Pretty Random (Java)

You can find the instructions for this lab at [More Than Equations][more-than-equations]. Create a new repository on GitHub to house your code. Be sure to make the repository public so that I can view and grade it.

We will use [Gradle][gradle] to automate common development tasks. Additionally, we will use [JUnit][junit] for unit testing.

## Building the App

You can build the app using:

```bash
./gradlew build
```

## Testing the App

You can run the automated suite of tests using:

```bash
./gradlew test
```

## Running the App

You can run the app using:

```bash
./gradlew run --quiet --console=plain
```

The two flags passed to the `run` command hide the noisy output from Gradle. You can see the details from Gradle by omitting those flags.

## Running Benchmarks

This repository is set up with [JMH][jmh] for benchmarking code. You can run the benchmarking utility using:

```bash
./gradlew jmh
```
